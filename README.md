# Arc-Eager Dependency Parsing with BERT and BiLSTM 

## Overview

This repository contains the final project developed for the course "Natural Language Processing" as part of the Masters in Data Science program. The project aims to implementent a static Arc-Eager model for dependency parsing using a neural NLP approach. This approach involves the development of a BiLSTM model and a Feedforward Network on top of BERT to act as a Oracle for the Dependency Parsing mechanism.
